      summary: Update the user's stripe payment info
      description: |-
        Update the Stripe information associated with this user. You must call this endpoint in
        order for the current user to transact with a system that requires Stripe information. If
        this is the case, the system's transaction_info will contain
        `stripe_info.stripe_customer_id` in the `users_api_fields` array.

        Note that it's not possible to call this endpoint for test users (using a test JWT) and as
        such we do not support test transactions for any system with the
        stripe_info.stripe_customer_id requirement. If you are interested in transacting, please
        contact sales@coord.co.

        The request body must contain a Stripe token for this user that's targeted to Coord. You
        can do this either by tokenizing a new credit card on Stripe, or by generating a token from
        an existing Stripe customer in your system. In order to target the token to Coord, you must
        have already registered your Stripe account as a "platform" via Stripe Connect, and we must
        have accepted an invitation to connect to your platform. Assuming that has happened,
        you'll be able to generate coord-targeted tokens via an API call like the folllwing:

        Assuming your already have a customer with id `cus_abc` on your side:

        ```
        curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/tokens \
          -u sk_your_stripe_secret_key: \
          -d customer=cus_abc \
          -H "Stripe-Account: acct_coord_connected_account_id"
        ```

        Note the Stripe-Account header, which tells Stripe to create a token targeted to a specific
        connected account. You must always include that header and set its value to the ID of
        Coord's connected account, which you can find here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/applications/users.

        See https://stripe.com/docs/api#tokens for more info on Stripe tokens.

        ```
          {
            "coord_targeted_token": "tok_123"
          }
        ```

        On success, the response will be the identical object with a customer_id field set. This ID
        is the ID of the customer that Coord creates on Stripe.
        ```
          {
            "coord_targeted_token": "tok_123"
            "customer_id": "cus_xyz"
          }
        ```
