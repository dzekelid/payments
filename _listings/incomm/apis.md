description: InCommrsquo;s Cashtie API connects your App to top retailers POS (Point
  of Sale) systems. You can build new or enhance existing Apps that improve the retail
  experience, including new in lane bill payments, cash payments for online transactions
  in retail stores, or to initiate the sale of digital products right from the consumers
  phone. All of these options are unlocked by simply providing a barcode displayed
  within your App that can be scanned and read by the retailers cash register and
  validated via the InComm/Cashtie real time POS integration.
